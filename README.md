# Extreme Classification

This repository contains the code used and run to obtain experimental results for my dissertation.

Specifically it contains:
* notebooks for experiments on 2D synthetic data
    * one for Figures 2, 3 and 4 - binary problem
    * one for Figures 5 and 6 - multiclass problem
* modified code for CIFAR-10 experiments
    * a clone of the code for ["Long-tail learning via logit adjustment" (Menon et. al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07314)
    * a clone of the code for ["Learning Imbalanced Datasets with Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss" (Cao et. al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07413)
* notebook for additional plots
* a pdf copy of the dissertation

(TODO) Add set up instructions (poetry/setup.py)
